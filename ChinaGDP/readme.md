# Using Non-linear regression to estimate China GDP.

First we will plot different type of graphs to learn their shapes.
- Linear
- Cubic
- Quadratic
- Exponential
- Logarithmic
- Sigmoidal/Logistic 

----

After that, we're going to try and fit a non-linear model to the datapoints corresponding to China's GDP from 1960 to 2014.

We will use a dataset with two columns,
- Year between 1960 and 2014
- China's corresponding annual gross domestic income in US dollars for that year.

We will then plot a corresponding graph to fit the data set. (Chosen sigmoidal graph)

# Conclusion 

Mean absolute error: 0.03

Residual sum of squares (MSE): 0.00

R2-score: 0.97
