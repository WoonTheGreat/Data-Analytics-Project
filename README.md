# Data-Analytics-Project

These are data analysis projects that I've worked on using Python, SQL and excel, utilizing visualization and various statistical analysis techniques to pull insights from data sets. 

----

1. NBA data - pulling data from basketball-reference.com, cleaning and reading graphs.

2. Creating EDA app for reading CSV file, only using sweetviz by generating data and easy reading graphs.

3. Another type of eda app for reading CSV, using streamlit, pandas & matplotlib.

To keep updating new projects through out the year
