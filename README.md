# Data-Analytics-Project

These are data analysis projects that I've worked on using Python, SQL and excel, utilizing visualization and various statistical analysis techniques to pull insights from data sets. 

1. NBA data - pulling data from basketball-reference.com, cleaning and reading graphs.

2. Creating EDA app for reading CSV file, by generating data and easy reading graphs.
